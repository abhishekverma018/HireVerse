## 🔒 Security & Best Practices
- **Password Hashing:** Passwords are securely hashed using `bcryptjs` before being stored in the database.
- **Token-based Authentication:** Standard JWT-based token generation for verifying sessions.
- **HTTP-Only Cookies:** Auth tokens are stored in secure HTTP-Only cookies to protect against XSS attacks.
- **Route Protection:** Route-level middleware ensures only authenticated users/recruiters can perform sensitive operations.
